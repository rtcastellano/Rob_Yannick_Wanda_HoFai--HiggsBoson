#Exploratory data analysis
##Sparse dataset
\includegraphics[scale = .8]{Images/missingnessandjets.jpg}
> -  Jet number can be treated as a factor for missingness

##Principal component analysis
\includegraphics[scale = .8]{Images/PC1PC2.jpeg}
\includegraphics[scale = .8]{Images/PCAanalysis.png}
> -  PCA shows that derived mass and label have a very strong relationship.

##Mass as a predictor of Higgs Boson presence
\includegraphics[scale = .8]{Images/sciencemass.png}
\includegraphics[scale = .8]{Images/density.jpeg}
> -  Derived mass of Higgs Boson is different from other Bosons and subatomic particles
> -  Simulated dataset increases signal, and must be offset using weights

##Correlation matrix
\includegraphics[scale = .8]{Images/corrplot.png}
> -  There are several variables with strong covariance among the 33 variables. 

##Initial Feature Engineering 
\includegraphics[scale = .8]{Images/log transformed .jpeg}
\includegraphics[scale = .8]{Images/pre log transformed.jpeg}
> -  14 Features with long-tailed distributions were log transformed to reduce the positive skew towards smaller values, generating a more uniform distribution.. E.g. DER_mass_jet_jet: The invariant mass of the two jets 

##Logistic Regression - Variable Importance 
\includegraphics[scale = .8]{Images/Sat Model - VarImp.jpeg}
\includegraphics[scale = .8]{Images/Stepwise - VarImp.jpeg}
> -  Saturated Model vs. Stepwise BIC Model

##Logistic Regression - Analysis
\includegraphics[scale = .8]{Images/residual plot- logistic.jpeg}
\includegraphics[scale = .8]{Images/AUC - logistic.jpeg}
> -  Saturated Model: R.Squared: 0.20227; Stepwise BIC model: R.Squared: 0.20223
> -  Chi-Squared P-value: 3.77 e-16 (Saturated) and 3.90 e-16 (Stepwise)
> -  AUC plots are also not very different from one another

##Choice of AUC as model fit metric 
\includegraphics[scale = .8]{Images/RF AUC plot.jpeg}
> -  Maximizes the true positive rate while also minimizes the false positive rate. 
> -  Produces a smooth and continuous function unlike AMS.
#Models
##Our models

> - Random forest
> - Gbm
> - Xgboost

##Random forest model

\begin{itemize}
\item Tuning parameters
\begin{itemize}
  \item mtry: Number of splits per tree
\end{itemize}
\pause
\item Performed 5-fold CV to tune parameters.
\begin{itemize}
  \item 20% of training data for mtry gride of 1, 2, 3, 6, 9
  \item 80% of training data for mtry gride of 4, 5, 6, 7, 8
  \item mtry = 5
\end{itemize}
\pause
\item AUC on training data = .9071
\item Kaggle rank = 1311
\item AMS = 2.57949
\end{itemize}

##About xgboost

> - Fast gradient boosting algorithm implementing in C++ by Tianqi Chen

> - Parallel computing

> - More tuning parameters

> - Not completely greedy in tree creation

> - Generally faster and performs better than gbm.

##Xgboost model

\begin{itemize}
\item Parameters we tuned:
\begin{itemize}
  \item nrounds: Number of trees
  \item max\_depth
  \item colsample\_bytree: Percent of parameters used at each split.
  tree
  \item eta: Learning rate
\end{itemize}
\pause
\item Performed 5-fold CV to tune parameters.
\begin{itemize}
  \item nrounds = 200
  \item max\_depth = 5
  \item colsample\_bytree = .85
  \item eta = .2
\end{itemize}
\pause
\item AUC on training data = .9254
\item Kaggle rank = 1340
\item AMS = 2.49958
\end{itemize}


##Xgboost variable importance

\includegraphics[scale = .6]{Images/xgboost_var_importance.png}

## Ensemble

> - Combined three models by majority vote
> - Kaggle rank = 1309
> - AMS = 2.58510

#Room for improvement

##Feature engineering

\begin{itemize}
\item We did not include any additional variables
\begin{itemize}
\item Basic physics. e.g. Cartesian coordinates of momentum
\pause
\item Advanced physcics: e.g. CAKE variable
\pause
\item Better understand the physics of additional models
\end{itemize}
\pause
\item Log transforms
\end{itemize}

##Models

> - More models
> - More sophisticated emsemble
> - Run different random seeds for the same model
